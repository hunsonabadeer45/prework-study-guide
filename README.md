# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is the first project of the coding bootcamp, using all the prework skills they had us study.  It is the very basic components like, Git, GitHub, Markdown, basic HTML coding, CSS, and a very basic intro to JavaScript functions to build a small site for this prework study guide.  I learned how to deal with iterations and branches in GitHub and the beginnings of coding with VS Code.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
